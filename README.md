LPG gas booking system in python
Abstract:
• The LPG Gas Cylinder Booking System is a desktop application designed to streamline the process of booking LPG gas cylinders for customers, as well as to provide administrative functionalities for managing bookings and user data. Developed using Python and the Tkinter library for the user interface, this project aims to enhance the efficiency and user experience of both customers and administrators in handling LPG bookings.
• USER side: For customers, the system offers a simple and intuitive interface where they can log in using their credentials. Once logged in, customers can book an LPG gas cylinder with just a few clicks. The system generates a booking confirmation that includes the expected delivery

Administrators can log in to access a dashboard where they can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database. This includes adding new customers, updating existing records, managing booking details, and deleting obsolete data. The ability to efficiently manage records ensures that the system remains up-to-date and accurate, thereby improving overall service delivery.
• Software: The application’s user interface, built with Tkinter, is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, making navigation straightforward for users of all technical backgrounds. The use of Python as the core programming language ensures that the system is both powerful and flexible, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.
• In summary, the LPG Gas Cylinder Booking System provides a comprehensive solution for managing LPG bookings and customer records. By integrating a seamless booking process with effective administrative tools, this system enhances the efficiency of LPG distribution 
services, improves customer satisfaction, and streamlines administrative task
